# sh-exit
An exit script for Openbox, inspired by CrunchBang's cb-exit, re-implemented in Zenity. Assumes Openbox and systemd, but feel free to modify it for your environment. 

If Zenity is drawing the window wherever it feels like, consider using devilspie and the attached zenity.ds file to center it.
